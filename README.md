# console-bird
Flappy bird clone for the terminal implemented using [console-canvas](https://github.com/jonathanplsmith/console-canvas)

Installation
--
Assuming `gcc`and `make` are installed, simply run `make` to compile.
The game can then be started by running `/.bird`. \
To ease installation, I have included [console-canvas](https://github.com/jonathanplsmith/console-canvas) already, 
although the version provided here may be outdated. \
Please note that only Linux/MacOS is currently supported.
